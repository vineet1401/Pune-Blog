                     <p> <span>Pune is a city located in the state of Maharashtra. Previously known as Poona, it is a
                           city
                           situated at the junction of Mutha and Mula rivers. It is also given the name – “Queen of the
                           Deccan”. It is considered as a capital of culture for the people of Maratha.

                           This city gained recognition in the early 17th century as the capital of Bhonsle Marathas.
                           Mughals occupied this city for some time, but it was acquired back by Marathas and thus
                           remained
                           capital for Marathas till 1817. Now, it has become a famous tourist resort which offers cold

                  <h2>Amazing Pune Tour</h2>
                  <span>Pune is a Maharashtrian city that flawlessly combines history and modernity with the allure of
                     colonial times in its architecture. The city is well-deserving of the title-Maharashtra’s cultural
                     capital. Ideal for a one-day escape, Pune is a vibrant city to be visited with your friends and
                     family. On a one day Pune sightseeing tour, you can explore the origins of old Poona, witness the
                     remnants of the Maratha Empire, and the present-day commercialized façade of the city.</span>
